                        <b>Partition mappings:</b> Wrote framework level code for LPM partition mapping and implemented
                        majority of mappings(Scsi, FC, PMEM, SRIOV, vNIC, VLAN, Concurrent performance level), which was
                        very complex part of overall LPM operation. We saw very less critical functional defects in
                        overall LPM mappings.
                        <p>
                            While working on Partition mappings, also worked with other team members to understand some
                            CLI commands to verify data.

                        <b>Polling multi-async jobs:</b> Solved front-end design challenge by implementing framework
                        code to handle multiple asychronous job polling. It helps in performing LPM migration, recover &
                        abort job polling of max 32 partitions at same time. Used in group validation job also.
